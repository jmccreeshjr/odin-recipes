            <li>1 white onion</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Below is a step by step process to make this dish</p>
    <h3>Prep</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely dice onions. Place into small/medium sized bowl</li>
        <li>Cube potatoes to a small proportion. Place in large, microwave safe bowl</li>
        <li>Place white bread in toaster, do not toast yet</li>        
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dampen a wet paper towel and place over the cubed potatoes in large, microwave safe bowl. Place bowl in microwave for 8 minutes on high power</li>
        <li>While potatoes microwave, open the pack of bacon, place strips in medium/large pan. Set the heat to medium/high and flip every 3 minutes.<em>*Important* If the bacon starts to spatter in the pan, reduce the heat slightly</em></li>
        <li>As the bacon strips are done cooking, place the strips onto a plate with a dry paper towel on top so that the grease gets soaked up by the towel.</li>
        <li>As potatoes are about to be done in the microwave, heat a large skillet on medium/high heat and add olive oil. Dump potatoes into skillet. Stir potatoes frequently and cok until golden brown.</li>
        <li>As potatoes are browning, mix in the diced onions and continue to stir frequently. Cook for another 5-10 minutes</li>
        <li>With less than 5 minutes left to cook the potatoes, start the toaster for the bread. If you have a toaster oven, start to toast the bread sooner. After the potatoes are done cooking, turn heat down to low and keep covered by a lid</li>
        <li>At the same time, heat a small pan with olive oil (if non-stick pan, do not use any spray) at medium heat, and crack an egg into the pan. The way the egg is cooked is left up to you.</li>
        <li>Take toast out of toaster, spread butter on toast.</li>
        <li>Place egg(s), bacon, potatoes, and toast and place on empty plate. Let food sit for 1 minute</li>
        <li>Serve with ketchup if desired</li>
    </ol>
